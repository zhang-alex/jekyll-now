Nah no we dont.

First, we'll need to establish why reading is necessary in the first place.

When you read a nonfiction book, you are essentially reliving the author's experience (be it life, research, or other topics), but at a significantly faster pace. You can essentially absorb hundreds or even thousands of hours of experiences in just a few hours. You'll be able to learn at a much quicker rate as well.

For example let's look at Laura Hillenbrand's _Unbroken_. This book tells the tale of a Italian boy who begins as a thief, ends up running in the Olympics, then goes to war for the Americans during WWII and ends up captured by the Japanese and sent to a camp. This whole journey, spanning decades, could've been relived in mere hours. Likewise, the lessons learned in those decades would be absorbed in those hours. No wonder the most successful people in the world all spend so much time reading.

So the debate; should you READ books or LISTEN to books?

I believe that reading books can be much, much faster than listening to them. For one, the speed at which you can listen to books is limited by the speed that the author reads. Clearly pronouncing each and every word with spaces in between is undoubtedly slower than moving a muscle in the eye. But while reading a book can be much faster, I personally find that the faster you read, the less information you're able to retain. In fact, I find that there isn't any speed you can read a book where you'll absorb more information than listening to it.

It can be argued that human imagination requires the eye to be idle. When people daydream, for example, they close their eyes first. Then, if they need to, they block our their ears. Reading a book keeps the eye occupied, significantly reducing your ability to paint a picture in your mind and really absorb the text. However, this isn't true when listening to an audiobook. This time, information is flowing through your ears, into your mind, where you fully paint a picture of the scene and use your eyes to wander around in that scene. I believe that it is in this state where you retain most of the information.

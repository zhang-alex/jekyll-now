This year's AMC was quite interesting - not exactly your standard AMC..

First off, the beginning questions were harder than they usually.

The last few, however, weren't especially hard.

A few questions in the middle were indeed misplaced, and some unconventional questions were asked (yes, you, #14, and #16)

If you were to ask me, I would say the cutoff is somewhere in between 105 and 114, with 90% confidence.

My next strategy, then, for the 10B, would be to go all out and answer as many questions as possible. Hopefully I'd be able to guess some of the questions right and get a higher score than the 10A

My score prediction: 126

This year's AMC was quite interesting - not exactly your standard AMC..

First off, the beginning questions were harder than they usually.

The last few, however, weren't especially hard.

A few questions in the middle were indeed misplaced, and some unconventional questions were asked (yes, you, #14, and #16)
